A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCN) is a type of neural network that uses How to Classify Photographs of Dogs and Cats Step-by-Step:

The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a common computer vision dataset in which pictures are classified as including a dog or a cat.

Although the topic appears to be straightforward, it has only recently been properly handled utilizing deep learning convolutional neural networks. While the dataset has been efficiently solved, it may be used to study and practice how to build, analyze, and apply convolutional deep learning neural networks for image classification from the ground up.

This includes how to create a robust test framework for estimating the model's performance, how to investigate model enhancements, and how to save and load the model to make predictions on fresh data.
